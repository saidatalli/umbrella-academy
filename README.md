# Umbrella Academy Characters Website
Umbrella Academy is an American time travel superhero streaming television series. I made this website that shows the names, nicknames and pictures of all the current characters in the Umbrella Academy.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery

My learning was focused on consuming a RESTful API that I created with Node.js and JavaScript. I used fetch to consume the API.

## Optimizations

I would like to use Bootstrap to speed up the development process. I would also like to use EJS to insert variables directly in the HTML file.

## Lessons Learned:

I wasn't able to consume the API on my local server due to cors issue. I learnt how to import cors module into my server.js file to fix that issue.
