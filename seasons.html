Elsewhere, an older man named Lester Pocket packs a suitcase and sets out for an unknown destination. When Marcus goes to get the briefcase, he discovers the Kugelblitz, a time anomaly caused by the crossing timelines, and is disintegrated. After witnessing this act of power, Grace, who now works as the Sparrows' maid, begins worshipping the Kugelblitz as her god.</td>

While captive, Luther learns more about the Sparrows and bonds with their Number Five, Sloane. Lila attempts to leave the city but discovers that her briefcase no longer works. After learning that Sissy died in 1989, Vanya goes on a self-discovery journey, coming out as a transgender man and changing his name to Viktor. The rest of the family accepts him with open arms. Allison travels home to find that Claire does not exist in this new timeline, spiraling her into grief and rage. Five and Klaus go to find Klaus' birth mother and discover that all of their mothers died before they were born in this timeline, creating a grandfather paradox.

											<td>Five explains the grandfather paradox, and a lovesick Luther rejoins the Umbrella siblings. Five and Lila reluctantly team up to solve the time paradox, realizing neither of their briefcases work, which is so unlikely it's effectively impossible.

Klaus confronts Reginald about their mothers, whom Reginald confirms he did not kill, and they end up bonding.

											<td>Because Harlan could not control the powers he gained from Viktor in 1963, he and his mother lived a difficult life, needing to move constantly. When Sissy died, he had a particularly violent episode. In the present, he reconnects with Viktor. Allison uses her powers to force Sloane to reveal the whereabouts of the briefcase, but Sloane does not know where it is. Frustrated, she and Diego go into a bar with a confederate flag on the outside, hoping to get into a fight. Luther and Viktor give Sloane back to the Sparrows as a peace offering, but at the last minute, Ben demands that they hand over Harlan as well. In the ruins of the Commission, Five and Lila find its Founder, an elderly future version of Five with a missing arm and a cryptic tattoo. Before he dies, he warns Five not to save the world. While playing in the Hotel, Klaus and Stan find a luxury suite called the White Buffalo, and Stan accidentally fires a spear gun which kills Klaus.

Viktor feels guilty about the trauma his powers have caused Harlan and enlists Allison to sneak Harlan out of the Hotel.

											<td>In 2014, Pogo is fired after a disagreement with Reginald over the Sparrows' training. He gives the Sparrows pills to sedate Reginald. In the present, Lila and Diego find a secret tunnel in the White Buffalo Suite which leads to an abandoned alternate version of the Hotel Obsidian, called Hotel Oblivion. Ben asks Luther to join the Sparrows. Pogo tells Five that the symbols in the tattoo connect to something Reginald was obsessed with called Project Oblivion. Lila admits to Diego that Stan is not their son, but is her friend Trudy's child, and she is just babysitting for a week. Harlan and Viktor succeed in transferring Harlan's powers to Viktor. Klaus tries to bond with his father and asks why the Reginald in the original timeline killed him repeatedly. To figure it out, Reginald decides to experiment by electrocuting Klaus to death. A Guardian attacks Lila and Diego in the alternate hotel and cuts off two of Diego's fingers. They escape through the tunnel in time to see Stan consumed by the Kugelblitz. Harlan tells Allison that he killed the Umbrellas' mothers, thinking that she already knew. Allison kills him and delivers his body to the Sparrows.</td>

At the Academy, the group celebrates saving the world and Luther proposes to Sloane, who accepts. Lila reveals to Diego that she is pregnant with their child; she pretended Stan was their son to test Diego's parenting abilities.

In the present, the siblings take shelter at the hotel as Luther and Sloane announce their wedding. Reginald and Klaus arrive at the hotel, but none of the siblings are interested in what Reginald has to say. Luther asks Viktor to be his best man, and leaves a bitter Ben out of his bachelor party. Sloane calls Ben out for his sullen attitude, telling him to stop relying on being in charge. With Klaus' coaching, Reginald attempts to be fatherly at the wedding reception and delivers a moving speech. Viktor tries to reconcile with Allison, who refuses to forgive him.

											<td>A hungover Five desperately tries to recall who was making a deal with Reginald the previous night. Reginald calls a meeting and explains that he built the Hotel Obsidian around a portal to the universe's "reset button", which requires seven people to pass through the secret tunnel and ring seven bells protected by a Guardian. Allison, Lila, Klaus, and Ben agree to the plan, but Diego, Viktor, Luther, Sloane, and Five outvote them and choose to stay. Allison apologizes to Luther and Viktor, but Luther believes she is manipulating him. Reginald murders Luther and blames it on the Guardian in order to motivate the group. Five remembers that Allison was the one with whom Reginald made a deal. The group flees through the tunnel as the Kugelblitz consumes the Hotel. Klaus tries to follow but Reginald pushes him back, thanking him for his help but telling him he is too much of a liability. To ensure he goes to the afterlife, Klaus throws himself onto the horn of the white buffalo and dies.</td>

											<td>Reginald, Five, Allison, Viktor, Diego, Lila, Sloane, and Ben arrive at the Hotel Oblivion, where Five tells Viktor that Allison made a deal of some kind with Reginald. Reginald summons Guardians to attack the group while they search for a seven-fold symbol. Five's arm is severed, but the Guardians are defeated. In the afterlife, Luther convinces Klaus to return to the living world, where he exposes Reginald's treachery. Allison tells Viktor that she made a deal with Reginald but that it had nothing to do with their brothers' deaths. Five spots a seven-star symbol on the lobby floor. All except Allison step on the stars, which activates the reset button but drains their powers. Realizing the process is killing them, Allison kills Reginald and hits the reset button. In the rebuilt universe, Allison is reunited with Claire and Ray, the Hotel Obsidian is gone, Luther is alive and not an ape-man, Five and Diego's lost limbs are restored, Sloane is missing, and everyone has lost their powers. As the siblings separate, a restored Reginald observes the city, now under his control, alongside his wife Abigail, who is alive again.
